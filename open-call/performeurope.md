This is the application proposal for the `yGest` project. It is shared in order for any interested parties to fill in the blanks where appropriate. Keep in mind that the running open call, Perform Europe [performeurope.eu], has set the required number boundary on registered partnering parties at maximum of 10 partners, from a minimum of 3 EU countries, with one artistic performance work enlisted at bare minimum (but not limited to).

##  Title in application proposal (250):
yGest: just one rock more to ripple

##  Perform Europe priorities which your proposal will focus Priorities<ENUM>:
    [ ] Diversity and inclusion      <!-- preselected -->
    [ ] Fight against climate change

##  Summary of your partnership proposal (1000):
Lets board a reactive polygon, scripting on top of [whitepaper.leapgest.com] protocol: a shelter for the dancepad machinery to grow in the wilderness.

The web-native [white-chest] of diverse tasks aimed at artistic expression (super challenging async fn* `jstr` learning with instant expressions and deferred results).

[github.com/jsonion/airmoth]
inArrType: WebAssembly may bridge JS and C++ as used with embedded, wearable devices, though at a cost: key-value objects need be assembled via array streams, native to musical expressions.

commonmark.airmoth & aircord: emphasising standard web code and applied maths, recording tools are outlined for representing codebase evolution and mini choreographies at creative's' disposal.

[github.com/jsonion/eyelighter]
extagon highlighting tool & reactiveOnion: master the modern reactive approach to make jstr-based interactive SVG components.

##  Country the lead partner is legally based in:
Slovenia

##  Short description of the lead partner (500):
Starting off his career as a web developer at age of 15, Blaz Beuermann was lead by his father Dimitrij (academic musician and pedagogue), to develop software for the school system (ZRSS, department for music).

Attaining a degree in piano and music theory there's much else to be absorbed. Decade long bulk on dancefloors, studies in economics, and orientation in tech startups; his base to tie in a broad array of cues and build upon previous capacities, as required to enstate the yGest project.

##  How does your proposal promote and implement the cross cutting priorities of Perform Europe: quality, innovation and fairness (1500):

Code as medium is inherently reliant on sound logic and mathematics. To reinforce the tendencies towards clarity and coherence the presentation layer is so framed to intertwine with experience of the live performance, as well as with current animation and scripting toolchains.

While self-guided learning might take a good decade before fruition, the outdoor multipurpose stage in proposal need implement a business model tailored to the needs of guest artists, in side coupled with the facility of artist residency.

Because market forces are demanding in the digital landscape, endulging in learning and performance may entail in for-profit activities. Agency of projects co-evolving in the space of yGest may bare witness to an increase in quality.

To lower the barrier of entry for the rural community space owners, partners in bridging cultural gaps and nurturing trust among clubbers, street artists, and the formal fields of contemporary dance and IT, the business model on the investment side is to lease building materials to end-customers (namely skatelite, marble, granite).

As yGest polygon design and software implementations may vary, construction services may be procured by facility owners in the region designate (less the preferential clause attached ahead).

Human labor is so differentiated from operational fees of the common digital platform: hereby at consideration of contracting agents, donation-based per transaction (Fine Gesture/Lepa Gesta, 2014).


##  Outline the proposal's activities and timeline (1500):
[...]


##  Describe your audience engagement, communication and promotion strategies (3500):

Phase: yGest polygon construction
-  sound system & lighting:
	 time for rehearsals and gatherings among artists andlocal experts (musicians, technicians, dancers, skaters) 

-  funbox & wallride:
   skateboarders to shape out missing items on skateable dancepad stage, given the miniramp and polygon scale

Phase: in-situ workshops
-  leap gesture:
   lip stall on open sesame and chickpeas, to assign mental space before preparing food ingredients, expanding dictonaries while accomodating musical expressions with live performances and pre-recorded musical themes

-  live performances on stage:
   dance theatre and improv, DJs and bands

-  jstr-airrails:
   from bodily moves on display to wiring up wearable fashion items with embedded, talkative `jsonion/jstr` components at the double set bank (in moonlight or sunbathing)

-  statistical analysis in applied microeconomics:
	 displaying case studies and deriving vivid scenarios for annual strategic board meetings, in form of gesticulation and recorded musical expression

Phase: starlink
-  in the linking between yGest polygons on-spot and cultural centres in the region and abroad, web layer can be utilized to feed livestreams or vectorized bodily movements
